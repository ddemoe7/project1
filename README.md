First group project - Visualizations

## Background
Philadelphia is a city that is rich in history and diversity. With a population over 1.5 million and neighborhoods undergoing constant changes, our group wanted to dive into the housing market. Through several different explorations, our group endeavored to find the answer to following questions:

1.	How have home sales in Philadelphia evolved over the past 5 years?
2.	How does location (zip code) affect pricing and number of sales?
3.	How has age of home affected pricing and number of sales?
4.	How does size of home affect pricing and number of sales?

This was a team effort the group repository is located here: https://github.com/jeremybar32093/philadelphia_housing_analysis

My part in this project was focused on using the data to see if location affects pricing and the number of sales in zip codes in Philadelphia. I created choropleth maps to try to find the answer to this question.
